Click [here](https://hopeful-joliot-33061f.netlify.app) to visit the site.
It's an updated pokedex project being developed in Reactjs.

The project is still under development and not complete.

Requirements and Notes:

1. Make multiple api calls to show list of pokemon.
2. Clicking on the pokemon will display data of that pokemon on top.
3. Search Function to search using pokemon ID or name.

Future Improvements:

1. Add next and previous button on the big pokemon card.
2. (Refactor) Reuse structure of the api call instead of creating it again in different files.
3. Responsive design for smart phone use.
4. Clean up scss files, remove repetition with variables and mixins.
